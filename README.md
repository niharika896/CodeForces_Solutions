# Codeforces Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to selected Codeforces problems, organized by topic. The aim is to maintain a clean and accessible collection of implementations that can help others understand common patterns while also giving me a reliable space to revisit and revise solutions over time. Each file reflects a focused approach to problem-solving, with consistent coding style and an emphasis on clarity.
